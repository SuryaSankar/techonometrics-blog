        <p>When I kept the five rupee coin on the juice shop's table, something felt different about it. On picking it up and checking it again, I realized it was not a 5 Rupee coin at all. It was a 20p coin from 1971! Some shopkeeper must have given it instead of a 5 rupee coin.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of it next to the current brass colored 5 rupee coin which was minted in 2011.</p>

<p>Both are remarkably similar in color and thickness.</p>
<p><img alt="Top View" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4xv1UL2nB42sYjiX8MKZ5w.jpeg"></p>
<p>The old 20p coin is slightly smaller in diameter.</p>

<p>But you cannot notice the difference when handling the change in a hurry.
For a couple of seconds I was irritated that I had been duped by someone. But then I realized that maybe it was unintentional on their part as well. It's not like people have a huge stash of 20p coins from 1971 which they can use to run a scam. </p>
<p>I wanted to blame the RBI next for not paying attention to this detail before printing the 5 Rupee coins. And that line of thought seemed silly as well. When I develop software, I don't want to support even 2 year old features. To expect RBI to have 40 years of backward compatibility seems ridiculous.</p>
<p>And that line of thought gave an idea. When life gives you old 20 paise coins, you do a macro-economic analysis out of it.
Considering that RBI would factor in the real value of a denomination before deciding what material and thickness to use in a coin, this means that in 2011 it considered a 5 rupee coin as being at the same value of that of a 20p coin in 1971. So a rupee's real economic value had fallen by 25 times in that 40 year period, which roughly translates to a 8.4% annual inflation rate.</p>
<p>So, is this hypothesis correct? Luckily historical data for consumer price index inflation rates is available online here - http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/india/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-india.aspx. I downloaded the rates for that 40 year period and calculated the geometric mean, which gave an annual rate of 8.15% !</p>
<p>Close enough I guess. The old coin is slightly smaller. And the real value of the metal might have fallen slightly, which would explain the difference.</p>
